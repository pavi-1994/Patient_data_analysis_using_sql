# Patient_data_analysis_using_sql

### creating a table named "patient" with columns PatientID, VisitDate, and DiagnosisCode.
The table called "patient" with the specified columns and data types:

1. PatientID is an integer.
2. VisitDate is a date.
3. DiagnosisCode is a variable character string with a maximum length of 255 characters. Adjust the size based on the expected length of your diagnosis codes.


I have used the following analysis on the patient table using SQL.

## Basic Information:

1. What columns are present in the "patient" table?
2. What are the data types of the columns in the "patient" table?

## Data Exploration:

1. How many records are there in the "patient" table?
2. What is the earliest and latest visit date recorded in the "patient" table?

## Patient Statistics:

1. How many unique patients are there in the dataset?
2. Which patient has the most visits, and how many visits do they have?

## Diagnosis Information:

1. How many unique diagnosis codes are present in the dataset?
2. What is the most frequently diagnosed code?

## Temporal Analysis:

1. Can you provide a breakdown of the number of visits per month?
2. Are there any months with a significantly higher number of visits?

## Repeated Patients and Diagnosis:

1. Identify cases where the same patient visited multiple times.
2. Identify cases where the same diagnosis code was given to multiple patients.

## Patterns and Trends:

1.Is there any noticeable trend or pattern in the diagnosis codes over time?

2.Are there particular diagnosis codes that tend to occur together in the same visit?
## Aggregation and Grouping:

1. Provide a count of visits for each combination of patient and diagnosis code.

2. What is the average number of visits per patient?

## Data Integrity:

1. Are there any missing values in the "patient" table?

2. Check for any anomalies or inconsistencies in the data.

## Advanced Analysis:

Using window functions, find the month with the highest number of visits and the diagnosis code associated with the highest count in that month.
